Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm excited to apply for this opportunity at Liftoff, where I can leverage my extensive mobile development and scalable systems experience to help drive innovation in mobile marketing technology. My background perfectly aligns with Liftoff's mission, particularly through my work at Enterprise Mobility leading a 10-developer team in rebuilding mobile apps using React Native, and my experience at Neeva developing mobile search experiences with real-time data processing. At Stationhead, I architected high-availability systems using AWS, implemented WebSockets for real-time communication, and built ETL pipelines for SQL, Redis, and Elasticsearch databases - all critical components for handling the scale and speed required in programmatic advertising platforms.

What excites me most about this role is the opportunity to apply my startup experience and technical leadership skills to Liftoff's mobile advertising ecosystem. Starting at Stationhead pre-launch, I helped pivot the product to find market fit and then scaled our infrastructure to handle exponential user growth, experiences that directly translate to the fast-paced, data-driven environment at Liftoff. My work building secure, scalable microservices and optimizing autoscaling infrastructure would be invaluable for managing the high-throughput demands of mobile advertising platforms, while my experience with load-testing systems and database optimization ensures reliable performance under the stampeding herd scenarios common in real-time bidding environments.


Best,

Andrew DeFranco
