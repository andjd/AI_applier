Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm thrilled to apply for the Staff Software Engineer position at Yum! Brands, where I can leverage my 9+ years of experience building scalable platforms to help revolutionize restaurant back-of-house operations. Your GraphQL-driven inventory platform perfectly aligns with my expertise in architecting scalable services using React, TypeScript, and modern web technologies, along with my deep experience in database design and multi-location system architecture. At Stationhead, I architected our first microservice and built scalable infrastructure on AWS using similar technologies, while at Kyra Health, I enhanced development environments to support multiple concurrent AI-powered workflows. My experience leading a 10-developer team at Enterprise Mobility and founding the Android team at Stationhead demonstrates my ability to mentor engineers and drive technical alignment across platform initiatives.

What excites me most about this role is the opportunity to model complex real-world restaurant operations in code while building systems that operators will genuinely love using. My startup experience at Kyra Health, Neeva, and Stationhead has prepared me to thrive in fast-moving environments where smart tradeoffs between velocity and stability are crucial. At Stationhead, I joined pre-launch, helped pivot to find product-market fit, and then scaled our platform to handle exponential growth, experience that directly translates to building robust, intuitive systems for Yum!'s multi-brand, multi-location environment. I'm particularly drawn to championing code quality and testing practices, having implemented frameworks that reduced bugs by 80% while maintaining rapid development cycles.


Best,

Andrew DeFranco
