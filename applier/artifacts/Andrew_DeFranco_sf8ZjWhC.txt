Dear Hiring Manager,

I am thrilled to apply for the Lead Frontend Engineer position at Casebook PBC, where I can combine my passion for building impactful software with your mission to empower community well-being. With 9+ years of full-stack development experience and a proven track record of leading high-performing teams, I am excited to contribute to the Casebook Platform's continued innovation in human services technology. My experience spans the exact technical requirements you're seeking: extensive React and TypeScript development, GraphQL integration, microservices architecture, and AWS cloud infrastructure. While my backend experience centers on Python with Django and FastAPI (equivalent to Java/Spring Boot), I've successfully architected scalable systems using event-driven patterns with Kafka, managed complex database infrastructures including PostgreSQL, Redis, and Elasticsearch, and designed robust REST APIs following OpenAPI standards.

My leadership experience directly aligns with Casebook's collaborative environment and technical needs. At Enterprise Mobility, I led a 10-developer team in rebuilding mobile applications, while at Stationhead I founded and grew the Android team, architected their first microservice, and implemented enterprise-grade security measures including cryptographically signed payloads and HIPAA-compliant systems at Kyra Health. Having worked across multiple startups and enterprise environments, I understand the unique challenges of SaaS platforms serving diverse client needs from small nonprofits to large government projects. My experience with CI/CD automation, agile methodologies, and cross-functional collaboration with product managers, designers, and stakeholders positions me perfectly to drive technical excellence while ensuring the Casebook Platform continues to make a meaningful difference in the lives of vulnerable populations.


Best,

Andrew DeFranco
