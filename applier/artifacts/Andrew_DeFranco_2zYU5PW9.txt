Dear Hiring Manager,

I am thrilled to apply for the Senior Software Engineer position at RealTime eClinical Solutions. Your mission to reshape clinical research with innovative SaaS solutions resonates deeply with my experience building scalable healthcare technology. At Kyra Health, I developed HIPAA-compliant LLM-powered tools for health plan discovery, giving me direct experience with healthcare compliance requirements and the unique challenges of clinical research technology. My full-stack expertise with React and React Native aligns perfectly with your tech stack, demonstrated through leading a 10-developer team in rebuilding Enterprise Rent-a-car's mobile applications and developing appointment booking systems using Next.js and React. While I have extensive Python experience equivalent to your PHP requirements, my backend development skills include building secure APIs, microservices architecture, and AWS cloud infrastructure using Terraform.

My startup experience at Kyra Health, Neeva, and Stationhead has prepared me to thrive in your fast-paced, innovative environment. At Stationhead, I architected their first microservice while scaling from pre-launch to handling exponential growth, developing the same scalable SaaS architecture and performance optimization skills you're seeking. I've implemented comprehensive security measures including OWASP best practices, cryptographically signed payloads, and secure third-party integrations over HTTPS, directly addressing your HIPAA and security compliance needs. My experience with SQL databases, test-driven development, and Agile methodologies, combined with my proven ability to mentor teams and drive technical excellence, positions me to make an immediate impact on your mission to advance medicine and save lives through world-class software solutions.


Best,

Andrew DeFranco
