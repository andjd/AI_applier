Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm excited to apply for the Staff Software Engineer position at Loop. With almost 10 years of full-stack development experience and a track record of leading technical teams through rapid scaling, I'm particularly drawn to Loop's focus on delivering customer value through engineering excellence. My experience aligns perfectly with your need for a technical leader who can establish robust architectural patterns and drive scalable solutions. At Enterprise Mobility, I led a 10-developer team in a greenfield rebuild of mobile applications using React Native, while at Stationhead I architected our first microservice for a tipping feature that required high availability, strong consistency, and integration with payment providers. My hands-on experience with AWS, Serverless, and React (equivalent to your Vue.js stack) combined with my expertise in REST APIs, database optimization, and continuous integration processes positions me well to contribute to Loop's tech stack and engineering culture.

What excites me most about this opportunity is the chance to work with a team that values both technical excellence and customer intimacy. My startup experience at Kyra Health building HIPAA-compliant LLM-powered tools and at Neeva developing AI-powered search experiences has taught me how to rapidly iterate while maintaining high-quality standards. At Stationhead, I joined pre-launch and helped the company pivot to find product-market fit before scaling to handle exponential growth, experiences that have honed my ability to balance agility with consistency. Being based in Columbus, OH, I'm particularly enthusiastic about contributing to Loop's blended work environment and collaborating closely with the team at your HQ. I'm confident that my combination of technical leadership, full-stack expertise, and passion for building scalable systems would make me a valuable addition to Loop's engineering organization.


Best,

Andrew DeFranco

Having friends who have created businesses creating and selling products, I have a personal stake in giving businesses the tech to compete with Amazon without being beholden to them! I'm also excited to join a successful startup based here in Columbus.

I also believe that my skills are a nice fit for your requirements.  I have owned technical initiatives from the design and plan phase through delivery and monitoring, working cross functionally with stakeholders and driving through ambiguity to deliver results on time.  I have worked with monorepos, including working to extract and separate discrete functions that resulted in performance bottlenecks. I have led small teams at Stationhead and a 10-developer team at Enterprise Mobility, and fostered a curious, supportive, and effective engineering culture.

I have worked on multiple projects with monorepos, including at Stationhead (PHP/Laravel), Kyra Health (Python/Django), and Affinitiv (Ruby on Rails).
