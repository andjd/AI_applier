    "label": "this is the question",
    "type": "text",
    "required": "true",
    },
    ...
]

Questions of type text may also include a max-length value.  This is the maximum length of the response in characters.  You must not go over this length, but your response may be substantially shorted than the maximum.

Questions of type "select" or "radio" will also contain a list of options.  You may only pick one of the options for your response.

Write responses based on the provided resume and background material of the candidate.  Do not make up or infer information, all your responses must be supported by information provided to you in the prompt.

Keep your responses concice. Directly answer the question.
